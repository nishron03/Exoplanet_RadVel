## Radial Velocity Method
The Radial Velocity Method is an indirect method of exoplanet detection that predicts the existence of exoplanets using the doppler shift in stellar spectrum.

Radial Velocity, $v_r$ is given by
$$v_r=k_* \ [\cos(\theta+\omega)+e\cos(\omega)]$$
where,
$$k_* = \frac{2\pi a_*\sin(i)}{P\sqrt{1-e^2}}$$
