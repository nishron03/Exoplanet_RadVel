## Radial Velocity Method
The Radial Velocity Method is an indirect method of Exoplanet Detection. This method predicts the existence of exoplanets using the Doppler shift in stellar spectrum.
The expression for the Radial Velocity, $v_r$ is given by
$$v_r=k_* \ [\cos(\theta+\omega)+e\cos(\omega)]$$
where,
$$k_* = \frac{2\pi a_*\sin(i)}{P\sqrt{1-e^2}}$$
